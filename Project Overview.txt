Project Overview
The objective of this project is to create a predictive model for Concrete Compressive Strength (MPa). The model is trained using a dataset comprising various material properties and environmental factors that influence concrete performance.

Key Features of the Dataset
The dataset includes the following input features:

Cement (kg/m³)
Slag (kg/m³)
Fly Ash (kg/m³)
Water (kg/m³)
Superplasticizer (kg/m³)
Coarse Aggregate (kg/m³)
Fine Aggregate (kg/m³)
Age (days)
The target variable is:

Concrete Compressive Strength (MPa)

Machine Learning Model
The model employed is a Random Forest Regressor, chosen for its robustness and ability to handle non-linear relationships effectively.

Key steps in the workflow include:

Data Preprocessing:

Normalized features for uniform scaling.
Checked for missing values and ensured data integrity.

Model Training:

Split the dataset into training and testing subsets.
Tuned hyperparameters to optimize the model's performance.

Evaluation:

Achieved  predictive accuracy, as measured by metrics like R² Score.

Deployment:

Integrated the model into a Streamlit-based web application.
Allows users to input material properties and predict compressive strength dynamically.
Streamlit Application Features
User Interface: Intuitive and visually appealing, allowing non-technical users to interact with the model easily.
Real-time Predictions: Provides instant compressive strength predictions based on user inputs.

Applications and Impact
This project has significant implications for:

Optimizing Material Mix Design: Ensures the most efficient use of resources while meeting performance requirements.
Reducing Costs: Predicting outcomes reduces the need for repetitive experiments.
Sustainability: Encourages innovative use of by-products like slag and fly ash in concrete production.
